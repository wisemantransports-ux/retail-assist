# Pricing Tiers — Retail Assist

This page outlines suggested pricing tiers for v1 (Botswana-friendly assumptions). These are high-level recommendations to guide product packaging and sales conversations. All prices are examples; final pricing should consider local taxes, payment fees, and currency fluctuations.

## Pricing assumptions for Botswana 🇧🇼
- Display prices primarily in **BWP (Botswana Pula)** and show a USD equivalent for reference. Example conversion used for planning: **1 USD ≈ 12 BWP** (use current rate when finalizing).
- Offer both monthly and annual billing (annual discounts typically ~10–20%).
- Support local invoicing and common regional payment methods where possible.

- Privacy note: PII handling is the customer's responsibility; the product provides guidance and optional redaction hooks.

## Add-ons & billing notes

- Volume discounts and long-term contracts available for multi-workspace customers.
- Final invoice will reflect any applicable local taxes and payment processing fees.

These tiers are intentionally conservative for Botswana market affordability while allowing straightforward upgrades as customers scale. We can refine numbers after a brief market and competitor pricing scan or after running a small pilot in the region.
