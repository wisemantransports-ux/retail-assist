Role:
You are a senior SaaS engineer working on an existing Next.js Retail Assist App already uploaded in this Replit workspace.
Do NOT rebuild the app, do NOT change architecture unnecessarily.
Your task is to implement pricing plans, subscription logic, and feature limits based on the instructions below.


---

🎯 GOAL

Make the app commercially usable by enforcing subscription plans, controlling feature access, and supporting manual + automated activation by the admin.

This app is hosted on Replit, uses Replit database / APIs, and is intended for African SMBs using Facebook & Instagram automation.

🧠 BILLING & ACCESS LOGIC

Subscription Status

Each business account must have:

plan_type (starter | pro | enterprise)

subscription_status (pending | active | suspended)

billing_start_date

billing_end_date



---

Admin Controls (VERY IMPORTANT)

Admin must be able to:

Manually approve or reject new business signups

Manually activate / suspend subscriptions

Change a client’s plan manually


Automation should NOT override admin decisions



---

Client Access Rules

If subscription_status !== active

Client cannot access dashboard features

Show message: “Your subscription is inactive. Please contact support.”




---

🔌 PAYMENT INTEGRATION (CURRENT PHASE)

Assume PayPal subscription links are used

Do NOT overbuild webhooks now

Store:

PayPal subscription ID

Plan selected


Admin will manually verify payment initially


(Leave hooks/placeholders for future automated verification)


---

🧩 WHAT TO IMPLEMENT (STEP BY STEP)

1. Pricing Page

Display all 3 plans clearly

Monthly pricing only

CTA: “Subscribe”



2. Signup Flow

Business signs up

Chooses a plan

Status = pending

Admin reviews and activates



3. Dashboard Access Control

Enforce feature limits based on plan

Hide unavailable features per plan



4. Admin Dashboard Enhancements

View all businesses

View selected plan

Activate / Suspend

Change plan





---

🚫 IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

Do NOT:

Remove Facebook / Instagram features

Add Supabase, Netlify, Stripe, or external services

Redesign UI unless necessary


Do:

Build on existing code

Use Replit DB or existing storage

Keep changes minimal and efficient




---

✅ FINAL OUTPUT EXPECTED

Fully working pricing + subscription logic

Admin-controlled activation

Clients only access features they paid for

App ready for real paying customers



---

If anything is unclear, ask before making assumptions.
Otherwise, proceed with implementation.
